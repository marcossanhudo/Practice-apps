### About
This is a simple agenda app, which I'm working on to practice automated testing, requirements definition, and user experience design, as well front-end development, and back-end development. It uses the basic combo of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in the front-end, and Java with Spring Boot for the back-end. The automated tests were written in Java, with Selenium.
The app enables users to schedule, edit, reschedule, and cancel events. It is also meant to make it easy for users to schedule events at times that work for everyone involved.
### Running the app
This app's project requires Maven to run. If you don't have Maven on your machine, you can download it from [here](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi), and install it following [these instructions](https://maven.apache.org/install.html). To run the app, it should be enough to follow these steps:
1. Save this folder on your computer, either by cloning this repository, or by downloading the folder;
2. Navigate to your local copy of the folder, and open a command prompt in that path;
3. In the command prompt, run the command ``mvn spring-boot:run``;
4. In your browser, go to the address http://localhost:8000/home.html to open the app's homepage.
### Important notes
This software is merely a programming exercise. **This is not production software**. Not only does it only save your data during runtime, it also lacks security and accessibility features. It may change without any notice, and it may come to a point where it is no longer updated. If you choose to use it, you are the sole responsible for any damages that arise from that use.
