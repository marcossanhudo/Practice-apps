			<p>This file is meant to serve as a base, on which other pages for the app will be built. It shows how things should be sized, colored, and laid out.</p>

			<h2>Controls</h2>
			<p>Besides paragraphs, sections may also be used to organize user input controls.</p>
			<p>User input controls, such as buttons, and text input fields, should be children of a common object, so controlling user input control availability becomes easier.</p>
			<p>When a control, such as a button, triggers a new widget, such as a form, to be opened in the same region of the same page, the triggering control becomes unavailable, and the triggered control provides a button to revert the situation. Triggering a control is a change of context.</p>
